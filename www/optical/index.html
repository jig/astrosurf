<h1>Optical Path</h1>

<p>
I use just a few combinations of lens, oculars and filters. 
I use just a couple combinations of guiding systems as well.</p>

<h2>Lens</h2>

<h3>Celestron SC8</h3>

<p>
This is a 1990 8 inches Schmit-Cassegrain. 
Focal length 2030 mm, 203 mm mirror (f/10). 
It is the black finished "Ultima" model. 
I use the embedded focuser and as it has no mirror locks it is somewhat difficult to focus precisely and it losses precise focus from time to time during tracking due to mirror minor shifts.
So, short/lots of exposures is mandatory.
A part from that, lots of photons per €.
</p>

<h3>Celestron focal reducer</h3>
<p>
Celestron Reducer/Corrector f/6.3 (model #94175) to widen the FOV (Field Of View).
</p>

<h3>Celestron light pollution filter</h3>
<p>
Celestron LPR (model #94127A) when I shot at home (Pallejà is in Baix Llobregat, an industrial shire in the Barcelona metropolitan area). 
Since I have sodium street lights burning everywhere (and just a few lighting directly over the lenses...). 
This LPR filter removes quite well the pure yellow sodium spectrum, and the hue can be mostly corrected by software (if you take pictures, in visual is another story).
It allows me to take pictures at least twice as longer before the whole image gets burned.
</p>

<h2>Mount</h2>

<h3>Astro-Physics Mach1GTO</h3>

<p>
	A 2011 run unit on a 42 inches pier. I usually control it with ASCOM 6 drivers (still in beta) with PHD. I've used the original Celestron SC8 Ultima '90 fork mount (no PEC, no Goto...) for (two) decades. Now I rewarded myself with an upgrade.
</p>
<p>
	To track scope position, I use Cartes du Ciel on sync.
</p>

<h2>Oculars</h2>

Used mostly to picture planets by projection. I use a 17 mm Celestron and 30 mm Celestron. 

<h2>Guiding optical paths</h2>

<p>
Tamron Maksutov 500 mm f/8 lens and a Nikkor 200-70 mm f/4 zoom. 
Both are old manual focus lens that were used for plain photograhy ages ago. 
Currently are perfect to use as autoguiders with a webcam. 
The Tamron lens, even though it has a mirror I believe it has no focus shifts so it is a perfect for autoguiding. If I have no perfect polar alignment, I use the Nikkor instead that has a wider FOV (and I can open up to 70 mm...).
The Nikkor (Nikon) zoom at 200 mm on the ToUCam gives aproximately the same field of view of the Celestron SC8 plus Focal Reducer on an APS-C (i.e. Canon 50D EOS).
