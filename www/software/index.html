<h1>Capturing and Postprocessing software</h1>

<h2>Capturing Software</h2>

<p>
	Iris to capture planetary video. It is freeware.
</p>

<p>
	PHD for autoguiding. It is freeware.
</p>

<p>
Canon EOS Utility to capture deep sky data. 
It is provided on any Canon DSLR.
Canon EOS allows to focus precisely (provided a bright enought star), configure all camera parameters and tethered shooting.
If you have autofocus lens, you can all that remotely (with Windows Terminal Desktop or similar).
I hope in the future implement some sort of LiveView exposure control to allow to focus on dimmer objects (stars).
</p>

<p>
	Cartes du Ciel to track telescope position through ASCOM hub. I prefer this to Stellarium in the telescope scope PC since Stellarium is not Desktop Terminal friendly.
</p>

<h2>Postprocessing Software</h2>

<p>
Registax for plantery video stacking and wavelet processing. This is freeware.
</p>

<p>
DeepSkyStacker for deep sky photography stacking. This is freeware.
</p>

<p>
Adobe Photoshop for final image processing. It is payware.
</p>

<p>
	Stellarium to compare pictures and preparing composition.
