<h1>M51 Whirlpool Galaxy | 2012/march</h1>

<p>
	230 minutes total exposure time
	</p>

<p>Two series of exposures taken on march 30th and 31st with SC8, LPR, f/6.3 Focal Reducer, 
Canon EOS 50D, autoguided, flats, darks and bias.</p>	
<p>First series (2012/mar/30) were 22 5 min exposures @1600 ASA</p>	
<p>Second series (2012/mar/31) were 4 30 min exposures @400 ASA</p>		
<p>Both series were stacked independently with DSS. Long exposure series were further processed by wavelets with Registax 6. 
	Both results were summed with Photoshop CS5</p>
<p>Leftmost object is the farther 15,4 magnitude galaxy IC 4278. This is my (currently) limiting magnitude from my suburban skyies.
