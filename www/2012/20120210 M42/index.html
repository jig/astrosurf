<h1>M42, Orion Great Nebula | 2012/feb/10</h1>

<p>
	Orion Great Nebula in a 1 h 45 min total exposure.  
	</p>
	
<p>
	Exposures taken with SC8, LPR, f/6.3 Focal Reducer, Canon EOS 50D @ 400 ASA, autoguided, flats, darks and bias.
	</p>	

<p>	
	High Dynamic Range (HDR) of M42 and this was an image made of 16 s exposures (20 of them), and 15 min exposures (7 of them).
</p>

<p>
	I first tried to stack everything with DeepSkyStacker with Entropy Weighted Average, but the end result was no good at all. 
	So I processed independently both stacks (15 min and 16 s) with DeepSkyStacker and Auto Adaptative Wighted Average, and then I stacked manually on Photoshop CS5 with Lineal Overexposure (Addition) and lowering the 15 min stack to a 30%.

<p>
	North is up.
	Field is 1º x 40'. Trapezium (&theta; orionis) is clearly visible (thanks to the 16 s exposures)
