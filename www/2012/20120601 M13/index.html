<h1>M13 Hercules Globular Cluster | 2012/june/1st</h1>
<p>Shot with a Celestron Ultima 8 with focal reducer, Canon EOS 1100D and LPR filter. 20 frames, 32 seconds each, at 3200 ISO.</p>
<p>No darks, no flats, no bias.</p>
<p>North is up.</p>
<p>Note: I changed guiding method from PhD to MetaGuide. 
	<p>I suffered from apparently "out of focus" stars, blaming either my C8, the focal reducer or the focusing procedure (I don't use masks, yet).</p>
	<p>After shooting unguided very short exposures of M13 (for framing) I realise that the images were (far) better than the guided ones.</p>
	<p>Looking for an alternative I came across MetaGuide that works similarly to PhD (à la "dummy, press here")</p>
	<p>It might be just that I use default settings for guiding, and could be that the default settings are better suited to MetaGuide than for PhD.</p>
	<p>I have yet to work on better than default values on that matter, since it might do a difference.</p>
