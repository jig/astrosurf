<p>Quality improvement respect <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/jig/2012/20120331%20M51">M51 2012 shot</a>: ASA 400, much longer frames, much more total exposition time, better polar alignment, much better scope collimation, and focusing was nailed with a Bahtinov mask.

<p>darks, flats, and bias</p>
<p>North is up.</p>
<p>Tracking with PhD2 with a Starlight Lodestar in OAG, stacking with DSS, processing with CS5 (levels, curves, downsize and JPG conversion). Polar alignment was set with the help of the ad-hoc funcionality that has released on the new PHD2.</p>
