<h1>M42 Orion Nebula (Trapezium) | 2014/february/23</h1>
<p>Shot with a Celestron Ultima 8 at prime focus (2030 mm), Canon EOS 1100D, LPR filter. 
116 best frames (out of 121) of 15 seconds each totalling 29 m, 200 ISO/ASA
</p>
<p>100% crop of &theta; orionis (A, B, C, D and E are fully resolved. F component is masked by the diffraction spyke/processing artifact on its left). Resolution in this shot is an improvement respect my former shots: first collimation was done with an actual star, not an artificial. This means that the angle of collimation was similar to M42, and not with the scope lying horizontally. And focusing was nailed with a Bahtinov mask.
</ul>
<p>darks, flats, and bias</p>
<p>North is up.</p>
<p>Tracking with PhD2 with a Starlight Lodestar in OAG, stacking with DSS, processing with CS5 (levels, curves, downsize and JPG conversion). Polar alignment was set with the help of the ad-hoc funcionality that has released on the new PHD2 (with PHD you could perform Polar alignment as well, but did not precise your Polar alignment error.</p>
