<h1>M42 Orion Nebula (Trapezium) | 2014/february/23</h1>
<p>Shot with a Celestron Ultima 8 at prime focus (2030 mm), Canon EOS 1100D, LPR filter. 
116 best frames (out of 121) of 15 seconds each totalling 29 m, 200 ISO/ASA
</p>
<p>100% crop of &theta; orionis (A, B, C, D and E are fully resolved. F component is masked by the diffraction spyke/processing artifact on its left). Resolution in this shot is an improvement respect my former shots: first collimation was done with an actual star, not an artificial. This means that the angle of collimation was similar to M42, and not with the scope lying horizontally. And focusing was nailed with a Bahtinov mask.
</ul>
<p>darks, flats, and bias</p>
<p>North is up.</p>
<p>Tracking with PhD2 with a Starlight Lodestar in OAG, stacking with DSS, processing with CS5 (levels, curves, downsize and JPG conversion). Polar alignment was set with the help of the ad-hoc funcionality that has released on the new PHD2 (with PHD you could perform Polar alignment as well, but did not precise your Polar alignment error.</p>

<h2>First try with a PixInsight</h2>
<p>I've been learning PixInsight (version 1.08.03.1123) with this image. At the end I used only the best 35 frames of the 116 whole bunch. I still have calibrated, registered stacked the sequence with DSS (I was unable to do the same with PixInsight, it says not enough stars found?), and used Photoshop for final curves touch up (I found that  PixInsight showed too much posterization for final curves selection. All info I've seen about this topic/bug refers to ScreenTransferFunction corrected on v1.8 which I do not use in this final step. ??).</p>
<p>I've used the process described at the Associació Astronòmica de Sabadell's Deep Sky Astrophotography course, and at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDLIZlQjChIxSASCeNqo_OMTSrMJtVtF-" alt="skyman">Raúl López's Tutorial de procesado con Pixinsight</a> as well.</p>
<p>And in this rendering, I would say that the Trapezium F component is more clearly distinctive from a C star spike, isn't it?</p>
